# Sonic can choose what shield he will get: Fire, lightning & bubble shield
# Sonic will have to go through various rooms to get to the goalpost, and the boss
# Sonic has 7 different bosses he will need to fight, who will have the chaos emeralds, before fighting the 8th
  final boss

# The bosses will be located in different zones/acts—the latter of which will have various risks and rewards for
  traversing them—the pros/cons also varying depending what shield you have

# If you don't have 7 chaos emeralds, you can't fight the final boss. Also if you die, you'll lose a life, but
  you'll have better odds of making it through the challenges that await, so experience can be an attribute.

If sonic goes into any given zone, there will be a chance for whether or not he takes damage through out that zone, depending on...

- What kind of shield he has
- How risky he wants to play
- How much experience he has

As for how many rings and lives he can potentially gain?

- What kind of shield he has
- How risky he wants to play
- How much experience he has

Then there can be a method to calculate the net ring gain/loss for every 4 segments before a checkpoint, and before a boss,
something like:


def net_ring_gain(self, shield, experience
